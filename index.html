            <br><br>

            The spirit of the Lord is upon me because He has anointed me to preach Good news to the poor, He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind’’, to release the oppressed and to proclaim the year of the Lord`s favor Luke 4: 16.

            <br><br>

            We are honestly delighted that you have taken your time and visit our website today to see what God is doing in the lives of people through this ministry around the world. This ministry was founded to preach the good news to the whole world, bring hope and confident to all people globally and restore them back to the kingdom of God, and to tell them that the right time has come for the whole world to see the splendor and glory of our God as it is written the book of prophet Isaiah 35: 1-10.   
            
            <br><br>
            The desert and the parched land will be glad: the wilderness will rejoice and blossom.
            Like the crocus

            <br><br>

            It will burst into bloom:
            It will rejoice greatly and shout for joy.
            The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon:
            They will see the glory of the LORD, the splendor of our God

            <br><br>

            strengthen the feeble hands: steady the knees that give way

            <br><br>

            Say to those with fearful hearts, Be strong, your God will come, He will come with vengeance: with divine retribution, he will come to save you.

            <br><br>

            Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped

            <br><br>
            Then will the lame leap like a deer and the mute tongue shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wildness and streams in the desert

            <br><br>

            The burning sand will become a pool, the thirty ground bubbling springs. In the haunts where jackals once lay, grass and reeds and papyrus will grow

            <br><br>
            And a highway will be there: it will be called the way of Holiness: It will be for those who walk on that way.  The unclean will not journey 0n it: wicked fools will not go about on it.

            <br><br>

            No lion will be there: nor any ravenous beast: they will not be found there.  But only the redeemed will walk there, and those the LORD has rescued will return.

            <br><br>

            They will enter Zion with singing: everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away

            <br><br>
