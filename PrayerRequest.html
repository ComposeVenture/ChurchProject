        <p style="padding: 3%;">God’s word  was written down for us  to  guide  and impact our lives  always and build our relationship with Him through   our deep faith and sincerely prayers to our creator, so that we may believe that He alone is the creator of the universe, the giver of live, the only healer , forgiver of our sins, the only  savior of the world and all power, and authority belongs to Him alone , so that we know and believe that ,He is  the healer and provider of our lives and sustain of  the universe.   Jesus said, the devil came only to steal, kill, and destroy but I have come to seek, and save the lost, so that they may have life in abundance; John 10; 10.  
            With God all things are possible without Him things are impossible. The scripture says God did extraordinary miracles through Paul so that even his handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them Acts 19:11-12, because God was with him. The word of God was written down for us as testimony. The lord Jesus said most Assuredly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven .Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in My name, Iam there in the midst of them Mt 18:18-20. And Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow Hebrews13:8.  When we accompany in the word of God and agree in prayer of faith, we see extraordinary miracles happening in our lives. The scripture says the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well: the Lord will raise them up , if they have sinned , they will be forgiven James5:14-18. Our God is able; there is nothing hard in his presence.  Please send your prayer request and we will stand with you in prayer of faith and believe God to perform great and amazing miracles in your life in Jesus ‘mighty name. When you send your prayer request to Vincent Wamanga Ministries International, we respond to it instantly. We will also take your prayer request to our prayer warriors’ teams to continue praying for you until your prayer is answered.
