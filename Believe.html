            We believe that the Bible is a revealed written word of God which constitute the infallible rule of faith and practice , God speak in His  written word by process of dual authorship , power, pride, honor, clothing Himself with majesty, glory: Job 40:10, and the Holy Spirit being superintended the human author, whereas there may be several applications of scripture is to be found as one diligently applied the literal divine interpretation under the enlightenment of the power and guidance of the Holy spirit.: John 7:17, 16:12-15,                   1 Corinthians 2:7-15, 1 John 2:20, it’s the responsibility of believers to ascertain carefully the true intent and meaning of scripture recognizing that the proper application is bind in all generations yet the truth of scriptures stands in judgments of men , never do men stand in judgments of it.

        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            We believe in the universal sinfulness and guilt of fallen man making him subject to God's wrath and condemnation: Romans 5:10-12, Ps 14:1-3, Jer17, Rom3:9-18-23, 6:23.
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            We believe in the substitutionary sacrifice of the incarnate Son of God as the sole and all-sufficient ground of redemption from the guilt and power of sin and from its eternal consequences: John3:16-20, 1:12, Eph2:8-10, Isa53:5-11, LK 24:46-48,Jn 1:49, Acts 4:12, Rom3:21-26, Heb 2:9.

        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">

        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            We believe in the expectation of the personal visible return of the Lord Jesus Christ in power and glory 1Thess4:16,5:11, Titus 2:13, Jn14:1-3,1cor 15:51-53,,1cor 3:11-15,2cor 5:10,Rev22:12.
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            we believe in the Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, to be the inspired Word of God without error in the   original writings, the complete revelation of His will for the salvation of men, and the Divine and final authority for all Christian faith and life 2Tim 3:16,Rev 22:18-19,1cor2:7-14,2peter1:20-21,mt 5:18,24:35,John 10:35.

        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            we believe in that Jesus Christ is true God and true man, having been conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He died on the cross a sacrifice for our sins according to the Scriptures. Further, He arose bodily from the dead, ascended into heaven, where at the right hand of the Majesty on High, He now is our High Priest and Advocate, John1:1-14,Mt1:18-23,Isaiah 7:14,LK:1:27-31,Heb 8:1,4:14-16,Ps 110:1,john 1:29.
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            We believe that the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ, and during this age to convict men, regenerate the believing sinner, indwell, guide, instruct, and empower the believer for godly living and service John14:15-26,16:7-15,Acts2:1-421peter
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            we believe that man was created in the image of God but fell into sin and is therefore lost and only through regeneration by the Holy Spirit can salvation and spiritual life be obtained Romans 6:23,3:23-24,5:12,Gen2:16.
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">

        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            We believe that water baptism and the Lord's Supper are ordinances to be observed by the Church during the present age. They are, however, not to be regarded as means of Salvation except that they are faithful acts by which we may obtain spiritual grace Romans 6:4, John 3:3-7,22,mt3:6-13-17,Acts 8:36-401John 5:6-10,
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">

        </p>

        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            we believe that Jesus Christ is the Lord and Head of the Church, and that every local church has the right under Christ to decide and govern its own affairs Acts 25:19-31,20:28,1cor5:4-7,1peter5:1-4.
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">

        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
