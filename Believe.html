This glorious God   is revealed and seen in His creation, His word, power , authority, greatness and demonstration of His mighty works in the land of Israel in liberation of the children of Israel from the hands of the oppressor Pharaoh king of Egypt to the promised land Canaan now Israel through his servant prophet Moses , Mariam, Aaron  and was also revealed in the ministries of prophets, the His Son and the ministries of the Apostles and us now, Exodus 7;14,-12;30,14;21-31,16;14-35, 1;22-2;22,2;5-10,3;2-5,7;14-12;30, who existing in three persons ie, God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit Mathew 28;19-20 .

            We believe that there is only one true God of Israel who is supposed be worshiped and honored by all men universally, He is the only one who created the universe and deserve our praise and adoration, other gods of other nations are false and idols Micah 4;5 lev;19;4,psalms 31;6,ps.96;5, Jeremiah 8;819, je. 12; 22, 1John5; 21, Exodus20;4. For God said whoever blesses Israel will be blessed , whoever curses Israel will also be cursed by God Himself, Israel is God’s chosen race, God’s servant , chosen people , chosen nation among other nations on earth, all true prophets of God were descended from Israel none of them in the bible came from other nations of the earth. The true God creator of the universe was manifested in the land of Israel and in the Bible difference to the ones of Israel is abomination to Him and to the world.    
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            We believe that there is only one God who lives in the highest heaven above all prinperlaities, cosmic powers, authorities, rulers of this darkness of this age, spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places; Ephesian 6; 12. We believe that Jesus Christ was true man and true God having begotten as the son of God and man through Mary, He was God incarnation justified in the flesh seen by angels , preached among nations and went up in His glory; john; 14;9-11, John 1;1-12, EXODUS 3;14,john;8;24, we believe that Christ appearance on earth and His human characteristic in person  signifies the God’s presence on earth; John;1;1-12, john 14;9.  
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            We believe that tell us all spiritual and physical divine plans of God to man in His relationship with His creator on in earth.
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            We believe that written word of God given to man to guide him in his walks of life in relationship to his creator.
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            We believe that Bible is the constitution of God given to man under the heaven that controls the whole universe.
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            We therefore believe that the Bible is the true written word of God given to man and the whole universe and we believe that there is no any other book or books or document or documents perfect and holy under heavens given to man and the whole universe in its wholeness in perfection, holiness, power, authority, glory, abundance, excellence with the Excellency of our God and our lord Jesus Christ.  we believe that Bible is above and supreme all other books or documents of the whole universe under heavens in containing all the full information of God pertaining abundant life of man both spiritual and physical in love, grace, peace, justice, integrity, equality, leadership, prosperity, forgiveness, development, governance, unity, solidarity, transformation, steady progress, mercy, kindness, compassion, eternal life, healing, miracles , power, signs authority, baptism, knowing true God, life, truth, holiness, righteousness, perfection, Godliness, faithfulness, humility, purity etc. , in fact the Bible contains everything we need in life in its quality and perfection of God , it surpass all other pretended books of whole world in everything therein.
            The LORD GOD ALMIGHTY speaks in His written word duel authority with divine power and authoritative in splendor, glory, greatness, mightiest, honor, commands, exaltation, lordship, kingship, immortal to all human race without beggaring power and authority from any one whether in heavens or whole universe whether seen or unseen planets , his voice reaches all corners of universe calling His creations to come to HIM through our Dear AND Beloved Lord JESUS CHRIST the only way , truth and life and every creature should respond to divine call.     We therefore believe that the six –six books of the Holy scriptures are inspired by God’s spirit through His holy servants and are the sole supreme authority under God for Christian believing and living; Jesus Christ is the center of the Bible and norm by which we interpret scripture,and that creeds and confessional statements are not instruments of doctrinal accountability but expressions of common faith under the authority of Christ and scripture.     
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            We believe that without controversy in the lord Jesus Christ, great mystery of Godliness was reveled through Him to us, that God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen by Angels, Preached among the nations, believed on in the world, and received up in glory;1Timothy3;16.
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">

            We believe that Jesus Christ is God, savior and Lord of all creation, He is the perfect revelation of God as well as God incarnate, the only mediator between God and humanity.
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            We believe that God’s power has given us everything in life through our lord Jesus Christ according to His abundant mercy begotten to us through the resurrection of our lord Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritantance incorruptible and undefiled which does not fade away but kept for us in heaven by the power of God through our faith for salvation in HIM and which is about to be revealed to us in this last days;
        </p>

            We believe that salvation is by God’s grace alone through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ and that people cannot save themselves by works of righteousness but that works of righteousness are products of the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.<br>
            We believe that authentic Christian life begins with conversion to Jesus Christ results in justification (forgiveness) and regeneration (new birth) these are gifts that cannot be inherited.
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 5%;text-align: left;">
            We believe that those who refuse to accept the lord Jesus Christ as their lord and savior have already been judged by God Himself because they have not believed in the one whom God has given to save all humanity through his sacrificial death on the cross and bring all who believe in him back to God from the repercussions of inherited sin   as it is written in the holy scriptures; John 3;18-20, Romans 5;12.
        </p>

            <br>
            we also believe that God heals through the means of medical science: Luke 10:25-37,2chro28:15,Mt25:36, MK15:23, Jn19:39, Gen1:12,9:3,35:16-21, Exd1:15-20, Isa38:21, 2kg20:6-9.

            We are that all the great works and all unprecedented and great things of the LORD GOD Almighty through our lord Jesus Christ on in the world were promised to born again Believers only and the church of Christ which is universal church which is the only true church of living of God on earth to take this divine message of great salvation and signs to the whole world.
            We believe that we are the inheritors of God’s promise , we are therefore mandated  by God to take the true gospel, deliverance, healings, miracles , restorations of God through our lord Jesus Christ to all peoples throughout the whole world; Mathew 10;8-10,james 5;13.
            We believe in the Lord’s supper and ague believers practice it in the right way that please the lord; 
            We believe that no one can believe God without seeing of miracles, wonders and signs ;john;4;48,acts 9;32-35.
            We believe that our Lord Jesus Christ was moving  in synagogues, villages, towns, cities and the whole country of Israel teaching and preaching to gospel of the kingdom ,while doing good and healing those who were oppressed by the devil and tormented with all sorts of demons and all kinds of  diseases among the people for God was with him. We therefore believe that we Christ’s witness the great works and all the unprecedented things He did in land of Israel and to the whole world until His seconding coming. 
            We believe that we are mandated and commanded to preach to all people throughout the whole world and testify to all Nations that the LORD JESUS CHRIST is the only one whom God ordained and mandated to judge the living and the dead, and that to Him all the prophets and Apostles declared and witnessed that , through Him and His mighty name ,whoever believes in Him will saved and receive remission of sins; acts 10; 42-43, acts 1;8,Romans;10;1,8-120,Isaiah 53;1;12.
            We believe that all those who receive    our lord Jesus Christ and also believe in His begotten holy name are truly and automatically children of God not born of the blood nor of the will of the fresh, nor of the will of man, but of God through the great salvation in our lord Jesus Christ; John 1;12.

John 3;3-7,acts 8;38-40.    
            We believe in immersion of  water baptism of John the Baptist and the baptism of our lord Jesus Christ as the only true authoritative and mandated baptism of God recommended and commanded in the holy scriptures of the Bible and ague all believers of our lord Jesus Christ throughout the whole this planet adopt , follow, practice it and believe in it as the only true baptism which our lord Jesus Christ did and commanded His church to do so exceeding and forever; Mathew;3-1-17,John 3;3-7-22,Mathew 28;18-20, Acts;8;38-40.
            We believe in divine visions , dreams and revelations from God, we believe that speak to us through visions, dream, revelations, signs, through other people or His servants , through His word, convictions, voices, insight, though  the power of the Holy Spirit  to guide and direct His and the church to do His will and His purpose on earth. We believe that a vision from God gives us direction to a person, a family, a community, a country, and the world over. The bible says where there is no vision or revelation the people perish; Proverbs 29; 18, Joel 2; 28-32, and surely God never does anything the LORD GOD does nothing, unless He reveals His secrets to His servants the prophets. Amos 3;7, Revelations 22;19-20.
            We believe in all the gifts the Holy Spirit and we believe  that  all are given to the church of our lord Jesus Christ to help , guide and strengthen the church with the mighty power of God to growth both spiritual and physically through various ministries to unity in diversity and for the equipping of the saints for the work of the ministry service, for edifying of the body of Christ , till we all come to the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the son of the living God, to perfect man, to the measure of the stature of fullness of Christ in likeness in holiness, purity, perfection , faithfulness, humility, Godliness, faith, love, power, gentleness, righteousness’ patience and justice , speaking the truth in love, grace, faithfulness, and grow up in in all things into Him who is the head  of the church which the whole body is joined, not children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of different and falls doctrine by trickery of people in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting; 1 Corinthians 12;1-12,Ephesians;4;11.
            PROPHECIES
            We believe in that all the strange tongues of the gift of the Holy Spirit and ague believers are gifted with it to speak   while ague them to follow the guidance  of the Holy Spirit directives for the benefits of the church and to build up the body of Christ Jesus our lord and expand the kingdom of God worldwide.  We believe that strange tongues is part of Holy Spirit and are good in the church of God  but it must be interpreted with two or more people  in its conformity to the church according the holy scriptures;  Acts 2;1, ;1corrithians 14;125. 
            We believe that the glory of this latter church of our lord and king Jesus Christ shall be greater than the former one, we believe that we are living of fulfillment of the prophecies.
        </p>

        <h1>TWO WITNESSES OF THE BIBLE.</h1>

        <p>
            We believe in revival, restoration, reformation, renew and total transformation of all things under the heaven before the seconding coming of Lord Jesus Christ. We believe that before the rapture occurs all things be restored back to God as it was in the beginning, the ancient glory of God should be restored back in the church universally and the name of  lord Almighty must be exalted and lifted up above all nations before the rapture of the church . we believe that this great revival birthed and ignite all nations and this global revival will spark  the whole world until the seconding coming of our lord Jesus Christ. 
            We believe in the two witnesses and two olive trees of the Bible, that before seconding of our lord Jesus Christ, God is raise the two witnesses and two olive trees and witness to the whole world the end time message. 
            GIVING. 
            We believe in giving our resources, material and properties to God, God does not eat our money or materials and properties but He demands us to give to Him so that His work may be done on earth. We believe our sincerely giving goes direct to Him and it is treasured in the heavenly account where our souls will be resided and where no thief cannot approaches nor moth destroys; Luke; 12;32-34, acts 10;1-9.
            We believe that Giving is essentials in presence of our creator and is part our righteousness before God in giving we accesses our righteousness’ before our creator, we honor God as our creator through giving and it shows our obedient to His commands; Malachi, 6;4-12,
            We believe that if we refuse to give to God , God will not bless our work of hands.
            When we give inform of offerings, tithes, thanksgivings, sacrifices, donations, grants to build God’s work on earth and help others in the times of need, we are serving God and submitting to His commands.; Mathew 25;31-44, Deut.15;7-11.
