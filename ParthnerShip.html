        <h1>WILLINGNESS IN GIVING.</h1>

        <p style="padding: 3%;">
            When you give to this ministry, you give it to God.
            If you are eager to give to God, through this ministry, God will accept your gift on the basis of what you have decided to give Him. The scripture say give and you will be given, the measurement you used to others, and it will be measured to you too: Luke 6:38.
           Above all else, giving draws our heart to God, Mt 6: 21 say: for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. When you give to God to support Christ’s work, you keep your money in the heavenly bank or treasure. You’re giving expressing your deep love for him. Nothing on this planet in more important than understanding and knowing Christ well.
           Your giving through this ministry , gives a great opportunity to store up your treasure in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and   where thieves do not break in or steal’  our Lord Jesus confirmed us that the heaven as a Heavenly   bank where our money are being store every day. Our giving increases our prosperity while we are still here on earth. Many people do not know that giving can result in material blessings flowing back to the giver. The scripture says that the generous man will be prosperous and he who waters will himself be watered Proverbs 11: 24-25. In other reason God reveals to us that we can anticipate such an increase is because He wants us to recognize that He is behind it. Our God has chosen to be invisible, but He wants us to experience His reality.
           Giving is the one way of testing our God because, He tells to test him, Malachi 3:10-12.
        </p>

        <h1>OUR GIVING SHOULD BE SACRIFICIAL</h1>

        <p style="padding: 3%;">
            For God so loved the world and gave us his son who died on the cross because of our sin, God demonstrated his divine love for mankind through offering his only son to die for the whole world, so that through him all might be saved from the repercussion of sin. John 3:16-20. Because God loved us so much and gave his son to die, indeed he died for us. This only sets a model and principle of giving to others as one way sacrificing ourselves to other through our generosity. 
            In the book of 1 John 3:16-18, it says, this is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for brothers and sisters. If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and truth.
        </p>

        <h1>GIVING IS PART OF PRACTICING OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</h1>

        <p style="padding: 3%;">
            Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness. You will be enriched in every occasion, and through us your generosity to God. This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of the lord’s people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God. Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, others will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else. And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you, because of the surpassing grace God has given you. Thanks are to God for his increscribale gift. 2 Corinthians 9:10-15
        </p>

        <h1>GOD IS ALWAYS READY TO BLESS YOU EXCEEDINGLY.</h1>

        <p style="padding: 3%;">
            Remember this: whoever sows sparingly will reap sparingly, and whosever sows generously. Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulation, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work 2corithians 9:6-8.
        </p>

        <h1>WHEN YOU GIVE TO GOD, GOD WILL COME AND LEND YOU FREELY.</h1>

        <p>Good will come to those who are generous and lend freely, who conduct their affairs with justice Psalms 112:5.</p>
